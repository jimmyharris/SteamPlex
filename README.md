# SteamTV

Launch Steam Big Picture Mode directly from Plex

## Installation

1. Rename repository folder or duplicate thereof to SteamPlex.bundle
2. Copy to ~/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Plugins
3. Launch it from the Application menu item in Plex
4. Wait a while for Big Picture Mode to launch, it's kinda slow to get started
